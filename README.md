# stock-analysis
# Overview of Project
## Purpose of this analysis.

  The analysis for a dozen stocks that Steve presented to us is almost finished. Just by clicking a button, Steve is able to present to his parents the most profitable stocks over  two years 2017 and 2018. But now Steve needs to expand the analysis on any number of stocks in recent years. Also, he is afraid that this new analysis takes a long time of       execution than the first one, that’s why he would like us to review the time of execution for our new analysis.

  To do that, we’re going to refract the first code so that we can do the same analysis on a lot of stocks and make the code work faster as Steve asked us to.

## Results

The refactoring has been successfully made, below are the results before and after refactoring our code.

**For 2017 :**

* Before refactoring

* After refactoring : it is clear that the execution time has decreased a lot.

## Summary
#### Advantages or Disadvantages of refactoring code
1. Advantages
* Refactoring code gives it the flexibility that makes it easy to add even more functions in the future
* After refactoring the code is well organized, understandable, and readable. Therefore, easy to maintain.
* Refactoring the code saves memory and improves execution time

2. Disadvantages
* It is time consuming refactoring a code.
* There is a high risk of making errors or introducing bugs due to the complexity of the code.
* Risk of Changing the behavior of the code when the basic aim is to change its structure only.

#### pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script.
The refactoring of the original VBA script was improved by several seconds. Moreover, the code has become more organized, readable, and understandable.
However, it takes time to undrstand well the code before refactoring to avoid errors and bugs.
