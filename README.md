# stock-analysis
# Overview of Project
## Purpose of this analysis.

  The analysis for a dozen stocks that Steve presented us is almost finished. Just by clicking a button, Steve is able to present to his parents the most profitable stocks over  two years 2017 and 2018. Now, Steve would like to expand the analysis on any number of stocks in recent years. In addition, he is concerned that this new analysis runs longer than the first one, that’s why he would also like us to review the execution time for our new analysis.

  To do that, we’re going to refract the first code so that we can do the same analysis on any number of stocks and make the code work faster as Steve asked us to.

## Results

The refactoring has been successfully made, below are the results before and after refactoring our code.

**For 2017 :**

* Before refactoring

* After refactoring : it is clear that execution time has decreased significantly.

**For 2018 :**

## Summary
#### Advantages or Disadvantages of refactoring code
1. Advantages
* Refactoring a code gives it the flexibility that makes easy to add even more functions in the future.
* After refactoring the code is well organized, understandable, and readable. Therefore, easy to maintain.
* Refactoring the code saves memory and improves execution time.

2. Disadvantages
* Refactoring a code is time consuming.
* There is a high risk of making errors or introducing bugs due to the complexity of the code.
* Risk of Changing the behavior of the code when the basic aim is to change its structure only.

#### Pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script.
After refactoring of the original VBA script, the code runs more faster than before . Moreover, the code is more organized, readable and understandable.
However, it takes time to fully understand the code before refactoring it to avoid errors and bugs.
